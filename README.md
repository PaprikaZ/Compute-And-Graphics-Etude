This program launched for learning vulkan by following [`the official tutorial`](https://vulkan-tutorial.com). I prefer rust programming language for high performance system programming. At that time, I am newcomer in both domain. Rather simpler code re-organization is applied with junior rust programming experience. This program is archived with 2022 suffix. Maybe in the future, a fresh version will be built.

Supported Platform: Windows

This program is another try on vulkan by following [`the vulkan guide`](https://vkguide.dev), after two years. The program is under actively developing. Self educating vulkan graphics api is quite hard for those who having no any computer graphics experience. Also because the rust language make things more harder. In this program, I introduced better rust coding style and thin vulkan api encapsulation. With least third-party crate dependency and verbose variable & type naming, I think understanding guide example is much more straight forward than original c++ version.

Supported Platform: Windows

## Contribution

Generally, most of program's creation purposes are supposed to be learn-by-doing. Which means, original requirement is sealed. Hence, bugfix is welcome.
